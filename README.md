# Beat Detector

This project is a simple beat detector built with Python, designed to analyze audio files and detect the beats within them. It uses the `librosa` library for audio processing and `matplotlib` for visualizing the detected beats.

## Features

- **Beat Detection**: Analyzes an audio file to estimate the tempo (in BPM) and identify the exact time points where beats occur.
- **Visualization**: Plots the waveform of the audio file and overlays detected beats for easy verification.
- **Customizable**: Easily modify the code to adjust detection parameters or analyze different types of audio files.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- `librosa`
- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/beat-detector.git
   cd beat-detector
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   Make sure you have Python 3 installed, then install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Add Your Audio Files**:

   Place your audio files in the `audio/` directory.

## Usage

1. **Run the Beat Detector**:

   ```bash
   python beat_detector.py
   ```

2. **View the Results**:
   - The script will print the estimated tempo (in BPM) and the times (in seconds) where beats are detected.
   - A plot will be generated, showing the audio waveform with vertical lines indicating the detected beats.

## Example

After running the script, you might see output like this:

```plaintext
Estimated tempo: 120.5 BPM
Beat times (in seconds): [0.464, 1.377, 2.290, 3.204, ...]
```
